# Counting-objects-python

A little program that counts the number of stars on a picture. The program works fine with the given picture, because the picture has to be in very good quality and very clear. Some noise can be removed with increasing the gaussian filter but in the smae time it affects the counting performance. The counted number should be about 308. The comments are written in croatian.

To run this program you have to use a python builder and you have to isntal all the libreries. I used sublime text 3 editor with a biult in python builder.
